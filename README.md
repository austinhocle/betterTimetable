# BetterTimetable

The BetterTimetable project, developed for Code Network using **NextJS (TypsScript)**, enhances students' experience by creating a user-friendly timetable. It integrates React elements for effective data display and uses server components to process QUT course data into an organized API, which populates timetables based on student preferences.

## üöÄ Install required software
1. Install Git Bash

> https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Install GitHub Desktop
> https://desktop.github.com/?ref_cta=download+desktop&ref_loc=installing+github+desktop&ref_page=docs

3. Install Visual Studio Code
> https://code.visualstudio.com/download

4. Install mySQL Workbench
> https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important Notes for MySQL Setup:
> - On the mySQL Downloader page, it will ask you for which option for the MSI Installer, select the first (though either should be ok).
> - Upon downloading the Installation Wizard, it asks you to select a version of MySQL to have on your computer, select ‚ÄòFull‚Äô version. This way you can install WorkBench and the MySQL Command Line Client
> - DO NOT modify network port during MySQL Setup. Ensure it is set to port 3306. If not, reinstall MySQL
> - YOU MUST create a root user with a password during installation. Do not lose these details! (But if you do then simply reinstall MySQL)

5. Install Node

> https://nodejs.org/en/download
> - Please note: You will need to restart VS Code after installing for it to take effect
<br><br>



## üöÄ Setup Project on VS Code (after installing software)
1. Open GitHub Desktop App
2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codenetwork/betterTimetable.git
```
3. Open the project in VS Code
4. Install necessary dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
5. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and update the `DATABASE_URL` to have your username, password, and port.

<br><br>

### Using GitHub from the CLI
If you‚Äôre using the command line interface (CLI), follow these steps:

1. Fork the Repository <br>
First, fork the original repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone Your Fork <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/betterTimetable.git
cd betterTimetable
```
3. Push Your Changes <br>
After making changes, commit and push them to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
4. Create a Pull Request (PR)<br>
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.<br>
Click "Compare & pull request" and select the correct branches.<br>
Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes.<br>

**Common Error: Pushing Directly to the Original Repository**<br>
If you try to push without this process, you may see:

```bash
ERROR: Permission to codenetwork/betterTimetable.git denied
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```
To fix this, fork the repository and follow the steps above.
<br><br>

## üöÄ Setup mySQL Database (after installing software)

Drizzle ORM doesn't automatically create the database for you. You'll need to create the betterTimetable database manually before proceeding. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create the Database Manually:
   - Connect to your MySQL server using a MySQL client. Do so via MySQL Command Line Editor
   - Run the following SQL command:
     ```bash	
      CREATE DATABASE betterTimetable;
		```
2. Update Your .env File:
   - Ensure your .env file has the correct DATABASE_URL pointing to the betterTimetable database:
			<br>
     ```bash	
        DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/betterTimetable"
      ```
		Replace user and password with your MySQL credentials.

3. Generate and Apply Migrations:
   - Use Drizzle Kit to generate and apply migrations:
     ```bash
        npx drizzle-kit generate
        npx drizzle-kit migrate
	    ```
     Alternatively, you can also try:
      ```bash
      npx drizzle-kit push
       ```
5. Seed the Database:
    - Run your seed script to populate the database with initial data: <br>
	  ```bash
	     npx tsx seed.ts
	  ```	
	
<br><br>

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Running BetterTimetable
1. Run the development server through VS Code Command Line Interface
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your local server via your web browser to see the result
```bash
 http://localhost:3000
```

<br><br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: for type-safe JavaScript development.
- **HTML**: for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: for global styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: for utility-first CSS framework.
- **React**: as the library for building user interfaces.
- **Drizzle ORM**: for object-relational mapping.
- **SQL**: for database management.

<br><br>

## üß™ Methodology
API Data Pipeline
- **Get Course Data**: Fetch QUT Course Data to identify activities for each unit and their timeslots
- **Get Teaching Periods**: Fetch QUT Teaching Periods to identify when courses are offered

<br>

Manage Data and Show Timetable
- **Allocate Timeslots**: Extract one timeslot from each given activity that does not clash. Consider student needs when selecting timeslots
- **Output Timetable**: Show a grid output of the given timeslots for the selected units
